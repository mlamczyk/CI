# Computational intelligence projects of 2023-2024

This project contains two folders:

- `lab`: solutions to laboratory tasks in the subject of computational intelligence in the academic year 2023-2024,
- `projects`: larger homework tasks:
  - `hitori.ipynb` is an attempt to solve the different sized Hitori puzzle using the PyGAD genetic algorithm,
  - `maximum_independent_set.ipynb` is an attempt to solve the maximum independent set problem (for different graph sizes) using the PyGAD genetic algorithm,
  - `project1.ipynb` is a DnD Character Class Classification,
  - `project2.ipynb` is a Rice Classification (1 - Jasmine, 0 - Gonen),
  - `project3.ipynb` is a sentiment analysis of tweets containing the "Genshin Impact" tag,
  - `project4.ipynb` is an analysis and comparison of the sentiment of tweets containing the tags "League of Legends" and "Dota 2".
